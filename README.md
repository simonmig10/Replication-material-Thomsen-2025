# Replication Material for the paper: Carbon Taxation in Agriculture: Who Bears the Cost of Reducing Emissions? - A Stock-Flow-Consistent Input-Output approach

This repository contains the replication material for the model simulations presented in the paper "Carbon Taxation in Agriculture: Who Bears the Cost of Reducing Emissions? - A Stock-Flow-Consistent Input-Output approach" The following materials are included:

Model Data: This folder contains the cleaned dataset necessary to run the model. Data cleaning scripts can be shared upon request.
Model Code: A text file with all the model equations, written using the BIMETS syntax.
Model Simulations: An R Markdown file (.Rmd) that runs the baseline model and executes the three shocks as introduced in the working paper.
